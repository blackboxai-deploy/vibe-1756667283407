# Internet Speed Test App - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Backend APIs
- [x] Create download test API endpoint
- [x] Create upload test API endpoint  
- [x] Create ping test API endpoint
- [x] Create network info API endpoint

## Phase 2: Speed Test Engine & Utilities
- [x] Implement speed test engine logic
- [x] Create test data generation utilities
- [x] Build results storage system

## Phase 3: Frontend Components
- [x] Create animated speed gauge component
- [x] Build test results display component
- [x] Implement network info component
- [x] Create test history component

## Phase 4: Main Interface
- [x] Build main speed test page
- [x] Integrate all components
- [x] Add responsive design and styling

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - No placeholder images were detected in this application
  - Application uses only CSS gradients and SVG graphics
- [x] Build and test application
- [x] API testing with curl commands
- [x] Performance optimization and error handling
- [x] Final testing and deployment
